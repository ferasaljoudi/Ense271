# Website prototype assignment completed using Figma:

I used smart animate in the about page. 
Note that there is three actions in the about page:
* You can drag the pictures left and right if you wish
* You can also use the arrow if you like
* In addition, the picture which is represented on the page will become bigger than the other ones

All the images are free and has no copyright.
All the texts were gotten from chatgpt.
