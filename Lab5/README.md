# Building a website for a Persona created for a Job Hunting Application:

## I used Figma to create a Persona for a Job Hunting Application:
* Link to Persona:
<a href = "https://www.figma.com/proto/zIzwhjps7BYK9FhF0Y8rWl/persona-template?type=design&node-id=0-3&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1">Click here</a>

## Then I created a wordpress site in Local for the Persona created for a Job Hunting Application
## Since the website was created in Local, you can only view it in the below PDFs:
